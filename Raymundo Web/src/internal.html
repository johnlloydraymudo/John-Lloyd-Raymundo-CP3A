    <p>My Embarrassing Experience is when I got wrong doing stuff and people will start staring at me and thinking why did I do that, and I start to scared to do rush doing stuff because some people will understand and some people will judge.</p>

    <p>And in my high school days, I poop in my comfort room in our school,because I eat so much rice before  and I forgot to go CR before to leave because Im late.</p>

    <h2 id="My Funny Experience">My Funny Experience</h2>
    <p>My Funny Experience is when me and my friends talking about some jokes and talking about our past like our childhood and we making something that we like to do and we laugh so hard like pranks and something bad and good but that's the way I laughing so hard and makes my day satisfied. And also with my girlfriend is my part of my life because we make some funny memories too.

    <p>I remember my funny experience this year is when I making a memes that I imagine, I can stop laughing because of that and when it's finished, I showed to my friends and while they watching they laughing them too and they asking "How I do that some memes?" and I answered, "Because of my crazy mind you know me guys, I like doing some jokes and memes" and we laugh each other</p>

    <p>My Saddest Experience is when I fall in love so many times but it ends up in leaving me without no reason and no one can comfort me but when some people is sad, I'll be there to comfort them and cheer up and when they asking to me that "Your okay?"Im scared to tell them because of my mind is too much overthink and I think no one can understand me.</p>

    <p>My sadness days when high school days is when my towel is missing and when our class is end, I start looking for my towel and I see my towel is full of powder of chalk.</p>
